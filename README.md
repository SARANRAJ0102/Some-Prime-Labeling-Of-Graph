# Some-Prime-Labeling-Of-Graph

    Throughout this project, we consider only finite simple undirected graph. The graph G has vertex set V = V(G) and edge set E = E(G).

    The labeling of a graph G is an assigning of integers either to the vertices or edges or both subject to certain conditions.

    The notion of a prime labeling was introduced by Roger Entringer and was discussed in a paper by Tout.A. Many researchers have studied prime graph for example in Fu.H. have proved that the path Pn on n vertices is a prime graph.

    In Dretsky.T have proved that the Cn on n vertices is a prime graph. In Lee.S have proved that the wheel Wn is a prime graph if and only if n is even. In Vaidya.k have proved the prime labeling for some cycle related graphs.

    In this project, we study some prime labeling of graph.
